## Squarespace, but for Conference Websites

This is a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assembly.com/confable](https://assembly.com/confable).

## To Get Started

Clone this repository, and also `go get github.com/tools/godep`, then run `godep restore`.

After that, `go run main.go` should run.

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.
